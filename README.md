## üß∏ How to Use

[Return](#)

‚≠ê Note that, please set the working directory in the Python code before running it.

For example:

```
import os, sys
os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = '0' # Set the visible CUDA, here we use the second GPU
WORKING_DIR = '/home/peizhi/Documents/gaussian-dejavu/'
os.chdir(WORKING_DIR) # change the working directory to the project's absolute path
```

### Prepare Training Data

Please follow https://github.com/PeizhiYan/flame-head-tracker and our example [```./examples/Personal-Video-Precessing.ipynb```](./examples/Personal-Video-Processing.ipynb) to pre-process your video.

When collecting your video, please consider following this guidance to achieve good reconstruction results [```./assets/personal_video_collection_procedure.pdf```](./assets/personal_video_collection_procedure.pdf)

### Personalize Head Avatar

Please follow our example to train the personalized head avatar model:
- [```./examples/Personalize-Avatar.ipynb```](./examples/Personalize-Avatar.ipynb)

### Avatar Viewer Demo

```
python run_avatar_viewer.py
```

We have prepared some head avatar models in the folder ```./saved_avatars/```. Please note that, ```imavatar``` models were trained on the IMAvatar dataset (https://github.com/zhengyuf/IMavatar). 





## üü† Environment

[Return](#)

### Prerequisites:

- **GPU**: 
  - Nvidia GPU with >= 6GB memory (recommend > 8GB). 
  - Training needs better GPU, >= 24GB memory is recommended. We tested the code on Nvidia A6000 (48GB) GPU.
  - We tested inference on RTX3070.
- **OS**: 
  - **Ubuntu** Linux is highly recommended (we tested on 22.04 LTS and 24.04 LTS).
  - We also tested running the inference code on **Windows** system. However, setting up the environment might be a bit more complex.

‚≠ê We also suggest you to follow this repo https://github.com/ShenhanQian/GaussianAvatars to setup the environment. Otherwise, you can follow the following steps:

### Step 1: Create a conda environment. 

```
conda create --name dejavu -y python=3.10
conda activate dejavu
```

### Step 2: Install necessary libraries.

#### Nvidia CUDA compiler (11.7)

```
conda install -c "nvidia/label/cuda-11.7.1" cuda-toolkit ninja

# (Linux only) ----------
ln -s "$CONDA_PREFIX/lib" "$CONDA_PREFIX/lib64"  # to avoid error "/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lcudart"

# Install NVCC (optional, if the NVCC is not installed successfully try this)
conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=11.7 cudatoolkit-dev=11.7
```

After install, check NVCC version (should be 11.7):

```
nvcc --version
```

#### PyTorch (2.0 with CUDA)

```
pip install torch==2.0.1 torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
```

Now let's test if PyTorch is able to access CUDA device, the result should be ```True```:

```
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

#### Some Python packages

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note that**, by this time we have tested the following versions of ```nvdiffrast``` and ```pytorch3d```:
- nvdiffrast == **0.3.1**
- pytorch3d  == **0.7.8**




#### Troubleshoot (Linux)

Note that the NVCC needs g++ < 12:
```
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-11 50
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-11 50
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/c++ c++ /usr/bin/g++-11 50
```

If there is problem with **nvdiffrast**, check whether it is related to the EGL header file in the error message. If it is, install the EGL Development Libraries (for Ubuntu/Debian-based systems):
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libegl1-mesa-dev
```
Then, uninstall nvdiffrast and reinstall it.


### ‚≠ê Step 3: Download some necessary model files.

Because of **copyright concerns**, we cannot re-share any of the following model files. Please follow the instructions to download the necessary model file.

- Download ```FLAME 2020 (fixed mouth, improved expressions, more data)``` from https://flame.is.tue.mpg.de/ and extract to ```./models/FLAME2020```
    - Note that, the ```./models/head_template.obj``` is the FLAME's template head mesh with some modifications we made. Because it is an edited version, we have to put it here. But remember to request the FLAME model from their official website before using it! The copyright (besides the modifications we made) belongs to the original FLAME copyright owners https://flame.is.tue.mpg.de 

- Download ```face_landmarker.task``` from https://storage.googleapis.com/mediapipe-models/face_landmarker/face_landmarker/float16/1/face_landmarker.task, rename as ```face_landmarker_v2_with_blendshapes.task```, and save at ```./models/```

- Download our network weights and save to ```./models/dejavu_network.pt```
  - Option 1 (from UBC ECE's server): https://people.ece.ubc.ca/yanpz/DEJAVU/dejavu_network.pt
  - Option 2 (from Github): https://github.com/PeizhiYan/models_repo/blob/main/gaussian_dejavu/dejavu_network.pt

- (Optional: for demo) Download pre-trained avatars and extract to ```./saved_avatars/```
  - Option 1 (from UBC ECE's server): https://people.ece.ubc.ca/yanpz/DEJAVU/example_avatars.zip
  - Option 2 (from Github): https://github.com/PeizhiYan/models_repo/blob/main/gaussian_dejavu/


The structure of ```./models``` should be:
```
./models/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dejavu_network.pt
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ face_landmarker_v2_with_blendshapes.task
